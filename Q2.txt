Q2. Explain the concept of event delegation and provide a scenario where it is beneficial.

Answer - 

Event Delegation - Event Delegation is a pattern based upon the concept of Event Bubbling. It is an event-handling pattern that allows you 
                   to handle events at a higher level in the DOM tree other than the level where the event was first received.

Benefits - 

* Performance Improvement: Attaching a single event listener consumes less memory than attaching individual event listeners to each element.

* Dynamic Elements: Event delegation works perfectly with dynamically added elements. Any new elements added at runtime that match the 
                    delegation criteria will automatically have the event listener.
                    
* Code Simplification: Instead of managing multiple event listeners, we only need to manage one, resulting in cleaner and more 
                       maintainable code.
