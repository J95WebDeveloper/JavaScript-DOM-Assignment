Q1. Explain the DOM and its role in web development.

Answer - 

DOM - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can 
      change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, 
      programming languages can interact with the page.


Role in web development -

* Dynamic Web Pages: It allows you to create dynamic web pages. It enables the JavaScript to access and manipulate page content, 
                     structure, and style dynamically which gives interactive and responsive web experiences, such as updating 
                     content without reloading the entire page or responding to user actions instantly.

* Interactivity: With the DOM, you can respond to user actions (like clicks, inputs, or scrolls) and modify the web page accordingly.

* Content Updates: When you want to update the content without refreshing the entire page, the DOM enables targeted changes making 
                   the web applications more efficient and user-friendly.

* Cross-Browser Compatibility: Different browsers may render HTML and CSS in different ways. The DOM provides a standardized way to 
                interact with page elements.

* Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Applications built with frameworks such as React or Angular, heavily rely on the DOM for efficient 
                                   rendering and updating of content within a single HTML page without reloading the full page.
