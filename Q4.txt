Q4. Explain the purpose of the addEventListener method in JavaScript and how it facilitates event handling in the Dom.

Answer - 

addEventListener - The addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the 
                   specified event is delivered to the target.

                 - Events are a specific occurrence or action like user clicks, keypress or page loads. The browser detects these 
                   events and triggers associated JavaScript functions known as event handlers to respond accordingly.

                 - Developers employ the 'addEventListener()' method for linking particular HTML elements with specific function 
                   behaviours when those events occur. Examples of events include clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and 
                   document loading.

                 - An event listener is a function in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur then responds to it. JavaScript is a 
                   programming language that developers use to make interactive webpages.
